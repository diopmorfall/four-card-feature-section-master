## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge about mobile-first development, Sass and flexbox which allowed me to replicate at my best the layout as required.

### Continued development

Surely I want to look back at this project to take inspiration from it for my future projects, but I want also to improve it to make it look as close as the requested design.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This helped me understand how I can generate a shadow like the one in the design.
